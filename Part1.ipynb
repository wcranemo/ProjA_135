      "Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone. THAT one didn't work either. Waste of 13 bucks. Product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with. None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears. Worst customer service. The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds. It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed. the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!! Very disappointed in AccessoryOne. Basically the service was very bad. Bad Choice. The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda). horrible, had to switch 3 times. It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them. Don't make the same mistake I did. Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off. I advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED! Doesn't hold charge. What a waste of time! I'm very disappointed with my decision. I also didn't like the \"on\" button, it felt like it would crack with use. I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear. We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product. $50 Down the drain. Absolutel junk. Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM. Very disappointing. I would not recommend this item to anyone. Big Disappointment with calendar sync. Not impressed. Just does not work. I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20 % left in the morning. Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point. In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement. The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally. Very unreliable service from T-mobile ! [...] down the drain because of a weak snap! This is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible. Pretty piece of junk. This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear. Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect. This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made. Awkward to use and unreliable. Horrible phone. If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it. My father has the V265, and the battery is dying. After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset. Defective crap. Poor Construction. They work about 2 weeks then break. Could not get strong enough signal. I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.The good Excellent starter wireless headset. Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call. BT50 battery junk!. The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear. camera color balance is AWFUL. It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320. Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!! I've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear. Plug was the wrong size. the phone was unusable and was not new. If I take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing. It's so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers, car chargers, cradles, headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out. poor quality and service. Poor product. I'm a bit disappointed. I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great. There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before. The design is very odd, as the ear \"clip\" is not very comfortable at all. At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr). dont buy it. So there is no way for me to plug it in here in the US unless I go by a converter. Soyo technology sucks. doesn't last long. Still Waiting...... I'm sure this item would work well.. if I ever recieve it! Poorly contstruct hinge. Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me! Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily. The bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint. This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise. Att is not clear, sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk. i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well. It doesn't make you look cool. Bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing. I put the latest OS on it (v1.15g), and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while. There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset. We are sending it back. I came over from Verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones.... the first thing I noticed was the really bad service. Unreliable - I'm giving up. After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part. It was a waste of my money. don't waste your money and time. Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset. I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing. Does not fit. I'll be looking for a new earpiece. However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons. Unfortunately it did not work. Couldn't figure it out Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would. Lousy product. Lasted one day and then blew up. I bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery. I was not impressed by this product. Not enough volume. Buyer--Be Very Careful!!!!!. Were JERKS on the phone. But when I check voice mail at night, the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message, and then I'm lost. Disapointing Results. I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking. I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers. You get what you pay for I guess. Bad Quality. It's not what it says it is. It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is. All in all, I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola. Sending it back. Everything about this product is wrong.First It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap. After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke. Phone falls out easily. The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off. Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something! A must study for anyone interested in the \"worst sins\" of industrial design. The BT headset was such a disapoinment. I have had this phone for over a year now, and I will tell you, its not that great. What a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone. Doesn't work at all.. I bougth it for my L7c and its not working. very disappointed. Earbud piece breaks easily. I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying \"what?\" It doesn't work in Europe or Asia. I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately. I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work. Horrible, horrible protector. Rip off---- Over charge shipping. Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear. I've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again. Piece of Junk. The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever. The battery is completely useless to me. The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast. So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it. Bad Purchase. It was horrible!. Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this. Not only will it drain your player, but may also potentially fry it. Improper description.... I had to return it. Cant get the software to work with my computer. I did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but I learned the lesson that I should not have bought this form online anyway. Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3. The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently. The commercials are the most misleading. Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack. I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt. It makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call. I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off. Piece of trash. Not a good item.. It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player. Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use. Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem. Cumbersome design. All three broke within two months of use. One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side. While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop. The camera, although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels, renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution. The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face. Item Does Not Match Picture. DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS Doesn't Work. Sprint charges for this service. I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone. This is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate. stay away from this store, be careful. It's A PIECE OF CRAP! sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone. Adapter does not provide enough charging current. Talk about USELESS customer service. What a big waste of time. Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.MAJOR PROBLEMS!! You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered. Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone. The construction of the headsets is poor. It's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (Razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an LG). No additional ear gels provided, and no instructions whatsoever. Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet. And none of the tones is acceptable. don't waste your money. This is infuriating. The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing. It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last. I found this product to be waaay too big. The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used. Uncomfortable In the Ear, Don't use with LG VX9900 (EnV). You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly. Can't upload ringtones from a third party. Do not make the same mistake as me. I might have gotten a defect, but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone. Not worth it. you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor. If you plan to use this in a car forget about it. I have 2-3 bars on my cell phone when I am home, but you cant not hear anything. Battery has no life. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Saggy, floppy piece of junk. wont work right or atleast for me. Don't waste your $$$ on this one. Audio Quality is poor, very poor. I've missed numerous calls because of this reason. The item received was Counterfeit. This product had a strong rubber/petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever. Don't bother - go to the store. VERY DISAPPOINTED. Kind of flops around. The pleather case doesn't fit. No real improvement. Truly awful. I've bought $5 wired headphones that sound better than these. As an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens. AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes. I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap. Disappointment.. I hate anything that goes in my ear. Warning - Stay away. Very Dissapointing Performance. Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster. Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple. Chinese Forgeries Abound!. It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem. NOT WHAT I WANTED. Who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery?. Battery lasts only a few hours. I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting. You need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone.Battery life is short. They made this case too small and is very difficult to install. This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand. All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it. Avoid this one if you can. The text messaging feature is really tricky to use. The cable looks so thin and flimsy, it is scary. I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger. Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive. The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown. Even in my BMW 3 series which is fairly quiet, I have trouble hearing what the other person is saying. This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!! Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data. We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacement My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it. They refuse to refund or replace. That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case). The worst phone I've ever had.... Only had it for a few months. The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing. I'm trying to return it for a refund. I went on Motorola's website and followed all directions, but could not get it to pair again. The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset. Don't waste your money!. Last time buying from you. I would have given no star if I was able. However, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one. However I needed some better instructions. I have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone. After 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden. It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed. I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck. VERY cheap plastic, creaks like an old wooden floor. The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking. Dont waste your money... in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic. I was sitting in my vehicle, with the cradle on my belt, and the headset lost signal. I recently had problems where I could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected. What a waste of money and time!. I only hear garbage for audio. The replacement died in a few weeks. The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad. Reception is terrible and full of static. The plastic breaks really easy on this clip. However-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games. First of all, it doesn't wear well. This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless. If there is a wind, it is completely useless. Internet is excrutiatingly slow. bad fit, way too big. Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked. Waste of money. It didn't charge for me. Sprint - terrible customer service. People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone. Design Flaw?. The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone. The battery runs down quickly. My 5-year old Nokia 2160 from Tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this. useless phone, simply deaf. Battery life still not long enough in Motorola Razor V3i. The battery life is highly unacceptable. I wouldn't recommend buying this product. If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one. worthless product. Using all earpieces, left or right, this thing will not stay on my ear. I ordered this for sony Ericsson W810i but I think it only worked once (thats when I first used it). if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre. If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you! It didn't work, people can not hear me when I talk. If you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone. Low Quality. A PIECE OF JUNK THAT BROKE AFTER BEING ON MY PHONE FOR 2 DAYS!!! How stupid is that? It was an inexpensive piece, but I would still have expected better quality. Does not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone. I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume. So just beware. I cannot make calls at certain places. Not good enough for the price. I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product. Terrible product, and waste of money! disappointing. The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena. I was not happy with this item. Bad Reception. I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice. When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides. I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side, I really abhor it. Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening. But now that it is \"out of warranty\" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it. Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125. The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome. You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs. So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing. WARNING - DO NOT BUY!!. Worst ever. disappointed. It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon. Painful on the ear. I'm returning them. Very Displeased. The instruction manual is lacking. Voice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls. The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT! Used and dirty. The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed. it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger!. Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support. I had to purchase a different case. I still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones, we just obviously don't share enough DNA to copy the design over to humans. I want my money back. No buyers remorse on this one!. However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up. The ear buds only play music in one ear. WORST PHONE EVER. poor voice clarity. It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two. Terrible phone holder. The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear. Don't buy it. REALLY UGLY. I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying. Having trouble with volume. Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player. Buyer Beware, you could flush money right down the toilet. How can that be?The audio quality is poor. Buttons are too small. Save your money.... I've had this item for 11 months now. For a product that costs as much as this one does, I expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does. The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work. Same problem as others have mentioned. This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first. Disappointed!. If you hate earbugs, avoid this phone by all means. Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model. I didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear, causing discomfort. Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping. My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5) Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc). Buy a different phone - but not this. Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it. I don't like this Nokia either. Customer service was terrible. I have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more. You can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once! Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE. Poor quality. Also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down. Mic Doesn't work. The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed. i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it. It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it. I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since. Do Not Buy for D807...wrongly advertised for D807. Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for. There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake. Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look. The buttons for on and off are bad. Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount. As I said above....PRETTY USELESS! the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone. The plug did not work very well. However, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn't receive and place calls. The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase. I was very excited to get this headset because I thought it was really cute. The phone loads super! Works as described. Works fine. Superb Phone on a Great Network. Razr Battery - Good buy. Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.Highy recommended Worth every penny. The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too. After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well. Definitely a bargain. Plan on ordering from them again and again. For the price this was a great deal. I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family. Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception. Jawbone Era is awesome too! Good product - incredible value. Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone. The file browser offers all the options that one needs.Handsfree is great. Worked great!. Battery life is real good. Plantronics Bluetooth Excelent Buy. i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced. It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time. So Far So Good!. Great Value. It fits my ear well and is comfortable on. Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't. Excellent!. I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well. Great product for the price!. This item is fantastic and works perfectly! Great Earpiece. I received it quickly and it works great!! This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up. The shipping time was also very quick! Simple, lightweight and great fit. Works like a charm.. Works as advertised. Blue Ant is easy to use. The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago. I love this thing! The phone is sturdy and waterproof. Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape. I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price. The bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a NYC commuter. Excellent wallet type phone case. It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip. The reception through this headset is excellent. Reversible plug works great. Love This Phone. Setup went very smoothly. Phone now holds charge like it did when it was new. Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman. Very good stuff for the price. I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead. After charging overnight, these batteries work great. Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly. I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great. #1 It Works - #2 It is Comfortable. For the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend. It seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside. IT'S REALLY EASY. It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother. It has all the features I want Great Pocket PC / phone combination. It does everything the description said it would. Those phones are working just fine now. My colleague & I now get great reception.A little expensive, but performance is great. Clear crisp sound. The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly. Logitech Bluetooth Headset is a 10!. It fits comfortably in either ear, the sound is clear and loud, and the charge lasts a couple of days. Authentic leather with nice shine and comfort .I recommend you this case !! The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips. Works well. Better than you'd expect. Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone! Good audio quality. Works great. Battery charge-life is quite long. I especially love the long battery life. This is hands down the best phone I've ever had. This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME. The best phone in market :). Five star Plus, plus. It has been a winner for us. It definitely was not as good as my S11. These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I've made in the last several years - seriously. I am very impressed with this headset from Plantronics. The headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them. Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold. Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing. My headset works just peachy-keen. It's fits like a glove and is strong, secure, and durable. every thing on phone work perfectly, she like it. awesome device. Comfortable in my hand. I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q, go figure. Best I've found so far .... I've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using. I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip. It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more. I love this phone , It is very handy and has a lot of features . The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase. The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears. I have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use Nice quality build, unlike some cheap s*** out there. T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere. And the sound quality is great. Better than expected. its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case. I have used several phone in two years, but this one is the best. !I definitly recommend!! Great for iPODs too. Works good. I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent. I really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice, elegant and cool. I got it because it was so small and adorable. Someone shouldve invented this sooner. It finds my cell phone right away when I enter the car. I would highly recommend this. It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned. Comfort for our whole family. Great phone!. Excellent product for the price. great...no problems at all!. I have yet to run this new battery below two bars and that's three days without charging. Excellent product, I am very satisfied with the purchase. I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision. It's very attractive and appears to be of good quality. This item is great, installed it, let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems This is a great deal. I'm pleased. I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic. The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad. Krussel Always good. Exactly what I wanted. I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far. .... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs. Works great, when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen. I would highly recommend this product. WELL IM SATISFIED. This one works and was priced right. Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell. Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are. Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color. good protection and does not make phone too bulky. Very good quality though This is an excellent tool, especially when paired with your phone's auto-answer. The screen size is big, key pad lit well enough, and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone. I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones. This battery is an excellent bargain! I would recommend this. It is light, easy to use, and has very clear reception and transmission. Nice solid keyboard. Love it.. Great armband. Good Quality. Price is good too. Great phone. Very good phone. Great it was new packaged nice works good, no problems and it came in less time then I expected!!!! I had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 Blackberry Curve! Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with. The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well. You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off.\" It has kept up very well. jabra ear gels \"R\" the best!. Only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far. Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case. Great for the jawbone. Excellent Phone. WORTHWHILE. Iam very pleased with my purchase. nice leather. It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles. Good price. Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!. This is a great little item. The reception is excellent! Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place. Great sound and service. Comfortable, Nice Range, Good Battery Life. The reception has been generally good. Great phone!. It feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes. I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight. You won't regret it! Its a total package. A pretty good product. Everything worked on the first try.The device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good. The sound quality is good and functionality is awesome. This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality! Incredible!. Timely shipment and quality product. I have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good. So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money. You'll love how thin it is. Magical Help. My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect. Clear Skype Calls, Long Battery Life, Long Range. We would recommend these to others. Lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone. much better than the hard plastic cases. I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price! I love all the features and form factor. Works great!. Restored my phone to like new performance. Better Than New. Great product and price. Really good product. I great reception all the time. I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell. I highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try. I had ordered a motorola data cable, got a very well finished and working product. This phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used. Portable and it works. It worked very well. I found the product to be easy to set up and use. The company shipped my product very promptly and it works well. Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch. I highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone. Very prompt service. And I just love the colors! Fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips. I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, I am very excited to have this source. I gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality. Good case!. Great case and price! I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better. This phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful. I connected my wife's bluetooth,(Motorola HS850) to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case. The seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again. Battery life is also great! Great Phone. The case is great and works fine with the 680. clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming. good item, low price. Very easy to use. I love my 350 headset.. My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great, the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit. Nice Sound. I got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and I'm glad I did. I wear glasses and it fits fine with them. This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching. very good product, well made. This case seems well made. I'm using it with an iriver SPINN (with case) and it fits fine. The best electronics of the available FM Transmitters. I highly recommend this case. Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price! Great audio!. This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional. It is simple to use and I like it. You can't beat the price on these. Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all. I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it! Will order from them again! Good transmit audio. In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim \"Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!? Really pleased with this product so far. Sounds good reasonably priced and effective, Its that simple ! Now I know that I made a wise decision. Love this headset! Excellent sound quality. Very satisifed with that. I've dropped my phone more times than I can say, even on concrete and my phone is still great (knock on wood!). It is very comfortable to wear as well, which is probably the most important aspect about using a case. I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed. I even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great! Excellent product for the price. :-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine. I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC. best bluetooth on the market. )Setup couldn't have been simpler. THey are so cool! I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem. Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day. I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear. Great software for Motorolas. Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone. Works great. Great phone. Great Hands Free Device. Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i. No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great. I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and it's a great color! I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price. 2 thumbs up to this seller It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did. Good case, Excellent value. Made very sturdy. The voice recognition thru the handset is excellent. Just what I wanted. I love this phone!. Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver). The accompanied software is almost brilliant. I searched the Internet, and found this one to be the best value. Product is exactly as described. I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine. It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation. Voice recognition is tremendous! great headset, very impressed - H500. The color is even prettier than I thought it would be, and the graphics are incredibly sharp. Love this product. My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand. It is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it. EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!. It holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous. I am very happy This is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving. It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable. Just really good.. So far, probably the best BT headset I have ever had. The range is very decent, I've been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no reception/sound quality issues. Excellent bluetooth headset. All in all I think it was a good investment. The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature. I own 2 of these cases and would order another. Awsome Device Works Great!!. This little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier. Great Phone. One of my favorite purchases ever. This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive. This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!. lightweight and works well. It looks very nice. I wear it everyday and it holds up very well. The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems. you can even take self portraits with the outside (exterior) display, very cool. I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great! But, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone. An Awesome New Look For Fall 2000!. We have gotten a lot of compliments on it. It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use. Great product. Works for me. It is a joy to use. Excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!. Any ring tone..Overall good phone to buy.. Great price, too! The mic is great. Product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and Boy was it cheaper! Good , works fine. Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e. I was very impressed with the price of the cases. O my gosh the best phone I have ever had. fast service. Absolutely great. This is a beautiful phone. Pros:-Good camera - very nice pictures , also has cool styles like black and white, and more. Works great!. Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection. I can hear while I'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting. A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I. cool phone. I usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair. I've owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it's the best mobile phone I've had. Its the best headset I have used. Excellent hands free tool. Otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound. * Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously! I'm still infatuated with this phone. I am pairing this with my iphone, and I could not be happier with it so far. Would recommend this item. Keep up the good work Amazon!! Well packaged, arrived on time, and works as intended. but it is great, i would really recommend it very clear, quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your iPod since you have the sound buttons on the headset. Sound quality on both end is excellent, I use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me !2. Gets the job done. Happy so far!. This is a great phone!. Protects the phone on all sides. Very wind-resistant. Has been working great. I love this bluetooth! Also makes it easier to hold on to. I would recommend it. It's a great item. Mobile Phone Tools are a must have. Great price also! The \"1.2\" mega pixel camera, being a part of a phone, is reasonably good7. That being said, for a phone, the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well. I have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end. Best headset ever!!!. Crisp and Clear. They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date. The battery works great! They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too). The tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate, etc. Worked perfectly! Linked to my phone without effort. A usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a real-world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget. Excellent dual-purpose headset. I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside. Very pleased with this headset. Very happy with this product. These are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent. Good product, good seller. These are fabulous! So far it has worked like a charm. Nice headset priced right. I wish I could enter negative values, admins?   The casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.   The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.   Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.   Graphics is far from the best part of the game.   It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.   Again, lame.   Glad I didn't pay to see it.   But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.   At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.   Exceptionally bad!   But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.   But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.   At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.   But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.   When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.   It's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.   The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.   I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this \"film\".   NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).   To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!   My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.   Regrettably, the film fails.   This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.   To sum the film up, \"Breeders\" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.   Wow, what a bad film.   Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.   & That movie was bad.   IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.   That was done in the second movie.   Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.   Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.   In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.   Wasted two hours.   There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.   Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, \"you see kids...\" Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.   The script is horrendously stupid.   One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.   I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.   All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.   There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.   Final Word: This Show is a real torture!!   Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.   The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.   A truly, truly bad film.   The directing seems too pretentious.   But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.   Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.   Avoid at any and all costs.   The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.   Top line: Don't waste your time and money on this one, its as bad as it comes.   I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.   The football scenes at the end were perplexing.   It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.   DELETE this film from your mind!   Avoid this film at all costs.   The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.   Now this is a movie I really dislike.   There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.   ) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.   Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.   Even the squibs look awful.   The script isÂ…was there a script?   The character developments also lacked in depth.   Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.   This movie is BAD.   Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.   How awful she is!   It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.   The story is beyond stupid.   The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.   It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.   I was very disappointed in the movie.   The visual effects were AWFUL.   All in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money.   End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.   This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.   1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.   The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.   I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.   Not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.   It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.   The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.   there is no real plot.   The story itself is just predictable and lazy.   The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.   There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.   I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!   The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.   A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.   It is not good.   The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.   You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.   If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.   I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.   The concert sequences just sucked.   Also the story and acting were weak.   Everything about this movie is stupid.   I literally vomited while watching this film.   Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.   If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.   The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???   The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.   But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.   The film looks cheap and bland.   I mean this in a terrible way.   Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.   I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.   This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.   In a word, it is embarrassing.   In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.   The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.   I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.   And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.   I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.   Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.   These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.   It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.   Avoid at ALL costs!   What on earth is Irons doing in this film?   Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!   I couldn't take them seriously.   About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.   Horrible!   The directing is sloppy at best.   There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.   If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.   And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.   Too politically correct.   I wasn't expecting Oscar material, but this?   Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.   The jerky camera movements were also annoying.   A bit predictable.   (very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.   Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.   I wasn't the least bit interested.   The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.   I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!   From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!   This is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.   The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.   Highly unrecommended.   Let's start with all the problemsÂ—the acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.   It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.   Filmiing was less expansive.   I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.   Watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.   The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.   I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained \"movie business\" of QuÃ©bec.   There was NOTHING believable about it at all.   I never walked out of a movie faster.   He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.   By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.   I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.   You can find better movies at youtube.   THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!   How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's ALL wrong.   This is definitely one of the bad ones.   Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.   The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.   Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.   Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.   His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.   This one just fails to create any real suspense.   Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.   This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!   An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.   Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.   The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.   One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.   There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.   The \"explosion\" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.   Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.   It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.   This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.   Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.   I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!   So bad...well...it's just bad.   This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.   Only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations MAYBE, & poor hummh!   The poor actors.   Then the film just dropped the ball.   But even the talented Carrell can't save this.   I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.   The least said about the acting the better.   At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.   Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.   I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.   Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.   Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.   It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.   The only place good for this film is in the garbage.   That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.   The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake!   The lead man is charisma-free.   Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.   It will drive you barking mad!   It is shameful.   It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.   I thought it was bad.   Nothing new there.   I am a fan of his ... This movie sucked really bad.   In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.   But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.   first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.   I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!   He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.   Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.   There were too many close ups.   Regardless, the film fails on most levels.   On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.   You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.   Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.   The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.   This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.   The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.   I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.   The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.   Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.   The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.   The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.   It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.   If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!   This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.   I hate movies like that.   He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.   Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.   What the hell kind of crap is that?!   I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.   Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.   The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.   It's very slow.   1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?   All in all, a great disappointment.   The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.   So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.   This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.   Very little music or anything to speak of.   The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.   Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!   It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.   I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.   It's like a bad two hour TV movie.   But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...   Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.   Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.   Again, no plot at all.   I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.   Not recommended.   Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.   Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.   A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichÃ©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.   The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.   It just blew.   There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.   i wouldnt see this movie again for free.   Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.   None of them are engaging or exciting.   The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!   Of course, the acting is blah.   Lots of holes in the script.   I'll even say it again Â– this is torture.   You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.   The dialogue sucked.   Very disappointing.   The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.   Why was this film made?   Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.   This movie is terrible.   Not recommended.   The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.   20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.   Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.   I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.   If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.   the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.   ) Don't waste your time.   The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.   What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?   The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.   I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.   My rating: just 3 out of 10.   Dee Snider just plain sucks.   The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.   There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.   Hated it.   The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.   But this movie is definitely a below average rent.   So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!   Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.   Rating: 1 out of 10.   It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.   He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.   By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.   This may be the only bad film he ever made.   With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.   It was forced, like everything in this movie.   I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.   In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.   Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!   The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.   Everything about it is just bad.   Nothing at all to recommend.   Didn't laugh or even smile once.   Really bad.   Not easy to watch.   This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.   A Lassie movie which should have been \"put to sleep\".... FOREVER.   So bad.   Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.   Otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.   But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.   Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.   If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.   His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.   This was a flick doomed from its conception.   I paid too much.   This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.   If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!   It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.   Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?   I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.   The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.   I am so tired of clichÃ©s that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.   This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.   Lame would be the best way to describe it.   It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.   I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.   Today the graphics are crap.   The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.   The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.   About half way through this film I started to dislike it.   Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie \"Grim\", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.   Seriously, it's not worth wasting your, or your kid's time on.   And the accents are absolutely abysmal!   Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.   Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.   The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.   It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.   Long, whiny and pointless.   I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.   Omit watching this.   This is not movie-making.   The dialogue is atrocious.   It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.   To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .   putting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character.   The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.   The budget was evidently very limited.   As for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.   Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.   Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.   Overall, this movie was cheap trash.   I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.   But it's just not funny.   I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.   The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.   I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.   Woa, talk about awful.   All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.   The story line is totally predictable.   Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.   It was so BORING!   Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.   There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.   The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.   \" But \"Storm Trooper\" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.   The script is bad, very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.   This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.   The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.   This scene is very strong and unpleasant.   Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.   Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.   The script is a big flawed mess.   Unless you're just out to visually \"collect\" all extant films of Austen's work, you can skip this one.   Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.   It was just too horrible.   The lighting is awful.   Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.   Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.   Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.   I'm still trying to get over how bad it was.   Camerawork - again, bad.   About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.   Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!   And, quite honestly, often its not very good.   It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.   There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.   The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.   Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.   It is zillion times away from reality.   This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichÃ©s to be admitted elsewhere.   I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.   But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as \"pretentious crap\".   The movie seemed a little slow at first.   It was horrendous.   The soundtrack sucked.   This was a poor remake of \"My Best Friends Wedding\".   The results, well, are a shame.   Everything stinks.   It is an insane game.   Now you know why I gave it a 10+!   In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.   Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.   This is high adventure at its best.   Okay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.   If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.   Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.   The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.   Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.   The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).   GO AND SEE IT!   I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.   It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.   I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973, when it was \"The Stranger\" and I loved it.   I rate this movie 9/10.   The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.   I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.   Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.   Yet, I enjoy watching it.   It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!   Gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!   (My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.   An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.   Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.   I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!   If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of \"The Way You Look Tonight\"), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.   Still, it was the SETS that got a big \"10\" on my \"oy-vey\" scale.   Funny, clever, hip - just like Pray's previous film, Hype!   This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.   The camera really likes her in this movie.   It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.   The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.   Predictable, but not a bad watch.   The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.   The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.   I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.   The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.   Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.   The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.   This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.   Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.   However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film \"about\" Mishima that is both superb & complex.   But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.   But it is entertaining, nonetheless.   steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy.   The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.   How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?   Totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.   If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.   You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.   The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.   Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.   The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.   ) some great music, and terrific scenery.   The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.   I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.   But this movie really got to me.   ) What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.   is pretty funny.   There is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).   The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.   Her role was played well.   That was nice.   For people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job!!   This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.   At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.   I have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.   Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.   All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.   I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.   The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.   The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.   In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.   Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.   Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.   However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.   Great movie!   It looked like a wonderful story.   Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in \"At Play In The Fields Of The Lord\".   You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.   Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.   The cast is good.   The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.   Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility.   The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.   This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.   Excellent cast, story line, performances.   Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal.   It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.   She's poised and amazing.   There still are good actors around!   And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.   I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!   Julian Fellowes has triumphed again.   You won't forget this movie!   Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.   I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.   It was so funny.   If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.   This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.   I advise you to look out for it.   I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.   Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.   The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.   I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.   Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.   I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)   Definitely worth seeingÂ… it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.   The film's dialogue is natural, real to life.   ;) Recommend with confidence!   I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.   PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.   Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.   As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.   It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing \"Turkey in the Straw\" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.   It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.   Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.   But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.   A great film by a great director.   Don't miss it.   I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.   Brilliant!   While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.   The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.   Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.   This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.   It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).   Conclusion - I loved it.   This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.   Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.   The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the \"acting coach\" are fascinating.   John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.   It's PURE BRILLIANCE.   The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.   It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the \"gadget\".   I will never forget it now.   A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.   Also great directing and photography.   The movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!   It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.   Definitely worth checking out.   This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.   For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.   Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!   I have recommended it to friends.   Up there with the best of Melville.   Waste your money on this game.   Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.   It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.   This is an extraordinary film.   Babie Bop is very cute.   An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!   They could be used as exemplars for any set designer.   Go rent it.   I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.   I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.   Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.   Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.   10 out of 10 stars.   Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.   This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.   But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.   Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.   This movie has a cutting edge to it.   I found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.   ***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.   I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.   This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films.   This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.   Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.   Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.   There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.   But I thought his acting was skilled.   This is an excellent film.   When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.   This movie is also revealing.   Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.   This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.   This movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven't seen before.   This is the number one best TH game in the series.   I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.   This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.   Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.   I gave it a 10   I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.   It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.   The kids are very cool too.   I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.   I enjoyed it.   It was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella \"The Dead.   It was also the right balance of war and love.   Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.   This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.   Emily Watson's character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.   I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.   And I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa AurvÃ¥g being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why.   The characters are interesting and you really care for them.   See both films if you can.   Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.   Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.   I left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.   They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.   An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).   The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.   I liked this movie way too much.   The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.   It was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.   The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.   Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.   All the characters in this film are tremendously well played.   Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.   Excellent short film.   But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman Â– and totally believable because he is a great actor.   \" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.   His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.   Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.   The transfers are very good.   And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.   This movie is so awesome!   I'll give this film 10 out of 10!   I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.   It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.   It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.   It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.   The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.   \" In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.   Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.   In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.   The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.   It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.   Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.   Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.   This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.   The aerial scenes were well-done.   Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.   The film gives meaning to the phrase, \"Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.   There is a brilliant twist ending.   Lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.   I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.   It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.   Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.   Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.   Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.   I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.   Meredith M was better than all right.   I sat riveted to the TV screen.   It's a sad movie, but very good.   If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!   And those baby owls were adorable.   This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.   The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.   He's a national treasure.   Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.   This film offers many delights and surprises.   The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.   Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.   A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.   As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.   There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.   As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening.   The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.   The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.   It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.   Raw and sublimely moving.   It has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.   the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.   He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.   Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.   It even has its sweet moments.   Actually, the graphics were good at the time.   This game rocks.   10/10   I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!   The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.   Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.   The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.   I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.   This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.   I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!   Everything about this film is simply incredible.   I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.   Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !   Very nice and relaxing late night viewing.   \" I love it.   The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.   Definitely worth checking out.   STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.   The story is also both funny and poignant at times.   Totally believable.   This is a very \"right on case\" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.   Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.   Shot in the Southern California desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkins creates a film like no other.   Some applause should be given to the \"prelude\" however.   The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.   The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.   When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from \"Don Giovanni\" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.   It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.   :) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.   An excellent performance from Ms.   People who like European films and \"art movies\" will like this movie.   The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.   After watching this film, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.   Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.   If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!   ) a happy, wonderful, feel good ending!   But \"Tiny Toons\" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.   It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.   A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).   Hitchcock is a great director.   And I really did find them funny.   A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.   Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.   I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.   It is a true classic.   Brilliance indeed.   I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.   All things considered, a job very well done.   It really created a unique feeling though.   The point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.   This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.   All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.   Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.   The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.   Simply beautiful.   It's a feel-good film and that's how I felt when I came out of the cinema!   Excellent performance.   I don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.   You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.   The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.   Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.   Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.   See it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.   Think of the film being like a dream.   10/10   Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.   \" With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.   It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.   Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.   You wont regret it!   If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.   Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).   I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.   The music in the film is really nice too.   I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.   The cast is always entertaining as usual.   A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.   Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY).   Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.   Give this one a look.   Alexander Nevsky is a great film.   The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.   Fans of the genre will be in heaven.   Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.   Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.   But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR.   His performance is simply genius.   His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!   This is such a fun and funny movie.   It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.   This is actually a very smart movie.   There is a lot of beautiful places.   But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.   I don't think you will be disappointed.   A good film by a great director!   Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!   It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.   This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.   It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.   Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.   There are some generally great things in it.   He owns the film, just as Spacek owned \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" and Quaid owned \"Great Balls of Fire.   For that, it's worth checking out.   It's practically perfect in all of them Â– a true masterpiece in a sea of faux \"masterpieces.   Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's \"Big Stick\".   I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of \"wonder\") are the excerpts from his works.   The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.   Barney is definitely super DE duper.   I just saw this film and I recommend it.   It is a really good show to watch.   Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.   All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.   In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.   Not too screamy not to masculine but just right.   A film not easily forgotten.   I loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.   Anne Heche was utterly convincing.   The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.   I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.   I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child.   I'd advise anyone to go and see it.   He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.   The rest of the cast also play well.   The writers were \"smack on\" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real.   The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.   Lange had become a great actress.   I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.   I rather enjoyed it.   I really liked that.   It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.   Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron! The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again. Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca. Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed. Avoid at all cost! The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten. The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits. I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking. We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left. Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one. dont go here. The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace. Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles. Crostini that came with the salad was stale. Will not be back. If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it. I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location. How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand! it was a drive to get there. Never going back. We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy. The food was terrible. Won't go back. I'd rather eat airline food, seriously. I think not again The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none. Would not go back. Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it. Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES! As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return. Total brunch fail. Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees. The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all. I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone! Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked. Horrible - don't waste your time and money. Not good for the money. I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving. I won't try going back there even if it's empty. It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor. When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing. The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well. We'll never go again. Over rated. My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything. Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check. For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed. But then they came back cold. The live music on Fridays totally blows. -Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point. Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater. The descriptions said \"yum yum sauce\" and another said \"eel sauce\", yet another said \"spicy mayo\"...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them. Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review. We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant. I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar. The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated. I just wanted to leave. She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted. We won't be going back anytime soon! I've never been treated so bad. Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more. I'm not eating here! I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs. The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor. By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known. There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better I give it 2 thumbs down Hell no will I go back I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat. For service, I give them no stars. The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes. We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed. Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore). Ordered burger rare came in we'll done. This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things. I was VERY disappointed!! We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste. I can take a little bad service but the food sucks. As for the \"mains,\" also uninspired. My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless. Thoroughly disappointed! I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again. As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means. The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked. I will not be eating there again. There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again. Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless. Just don't know why they were so slow. Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me. did not like at all. The selection of food was not the best. This one is simply a disappointment. say bye bye to your tip lady! The place was not clean and the food oh so stale! 2 times - Very Bad Customer Service ! It was way over fried. A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!! Spend your money elsewhere. - They never brought a salad we asked for. I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible. very tough and very short on flavor! The warm beer didn't help. Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it. I've had better bagels from the grocery store. This is a disgrace. The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach. Soggy and not good. By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse. I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself. I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food. We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them. I can't tell you how disappointed I was. Weird vibe from owners. Will not be back! Disappointing experience. Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho. The service was not up to par, either. The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous. There is nothing authentic about this place. Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul. I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one. On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate. Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish. If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where. I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives. But now I was completely grossed out. I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place. We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting). too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place. The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant. The Burrittos Blah! The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer. The service here leaves a lot to be desired. This place is horrible and way overpriced. Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back. It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor. The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old. Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked? It was not good. No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it. This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant. It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat. I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair. The service was terrible though. Service was slow and not attentive. My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too. The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12. The kids play area is NASTY! Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it. Not tasty and the texture was just nasty. I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch. If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars. Do not waste your money here! like the other reviewer said \"you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again.\" Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh. Boy was that sucker dry!!. walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating. I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed. This place deserves no stars. On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop. Worst food/service I've had in a while. We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either. It was equally awful. After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment! Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks. A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad. Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did! It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign. this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's. I probably won't be coming back here. Terrible management. seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. My gyro was basically lettuce only. I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly! Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes. I took back my money and got outta there. Waiter was a jerk. I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak. It was extremely \"crumby\" and pretty tasteless. Then our food came out, disappointment ensued. Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register. Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table. Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had. Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries. I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place. Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom. I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food. I got home to see the driest damn wings ever! I would not recommend this place. The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger. If you are reading this please don't go there. The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather. not even a \"hello, we will be right with you.\" first time there and might just be the last. Appetite instantly gone. The service here is fair at best. This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED! It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it. I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore. Won't ever go here again. The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad. The service was poor and thats being nice. This place should honestly be blown up. The service was meh. The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced. I waited and waited. The fried rice was dry as well. This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food. We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything. My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service. At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy. This place is disgusting! We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh. Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas. Will never, ever go back. I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?! Must have been an off night at this place. The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat. Strike 2, who wants to be rushed. I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list. They dropped more than the ball. I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed. the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever. The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us. Worst martini ever! Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN! Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too. There is nothing privileged about working/eating there. Which are small and not worth the price. AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT! Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that... And the beans and rice were mediocre at best. After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods. We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one! Definitely not worth the $3 I paid. I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful. For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon. Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed. Probably not in a hurry to go back. It was probably dirt. Waited and waited and waited. The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place! Terrible service! I wouldn't return. Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management. I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food. It's too bad the food is so damn generic. This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food. Not good by any stretch of the imagination. The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see! In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience. very slow at seating even with reservation. Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom. The burger... I got the \"Gold Standard\" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed. The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. We could not believe how dirty the oysters were! She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door. It was packed!! I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services. If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again. The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying. REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good. I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed. Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying. We will not be coming back. We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived. My girlfriend's veal was very bad. I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it. Mediocre food. We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well. WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying. Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick. The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu. My friend did not like his Bloody Mary. The service was a bit lacking. a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait. Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late. We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us. I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine. We won't be going back. He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas. We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home. The service was terrible, food was mediocre. Don't bother coming here. Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE. Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold. The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us. The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an \"Are you being helped?\" The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons. Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back. The worst was the salmon sashimi. Would not recommend to others. Don't do it!!!! It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant. I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place. What did bother me, was the slow service. i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that? I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only. Not my thing. This place lacked style!! I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day. Service sucks. I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland. Nothing special. The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland. The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily. for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food. Overpriced for what you are getting. Spend your money and time some place else. I probably won't be back, to be honest. I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere. the presentation of the food was awful. First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!! Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon. I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage. Tasted like dirt. Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in. I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00. It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done. I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon. I would not recommend this place. My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing. Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold. TOTAL WASTE OF TIME. I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense. I will not return. However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible. Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings. It was pretty gross! Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :( Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing. The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it. Very poor service. The management is rude. Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal. Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat. I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water. Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up. The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible. I won't be back. The real disappointment was our waiter. I was so insulted. What happened next was pretty....off putting. Service stinks here! Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked. The bus boy on the other hand was so rude. I probably would not go here again. The RI style calamari was a joke. If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart? -My order was not correct. The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way. Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small. The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless. It wasn't busy at all and now we know why. And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me. I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch. Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website! I dressed up to be treated so rudely! I consider this theft. I'm not impressed with the concept or the food. Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting. Don't waste your time here. Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star. I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack. RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT. The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork. After two I felt disgusting. Food was below average. Very, very sad. Con: spotty service. Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon. WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED. (It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold. Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse. The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow. Overall I was not impressed and would not go back. For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone. So don't go there if you are looking for good food... The ambiance isn't much better. The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either. Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!! I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor. I was mortified. The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined. After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert. Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food. Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible. We waited for forty five minutes in vain. I'm super pissd. And the drinks are WEAK, people! I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough. Very disappointing!!! The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables). The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted. They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food. I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back \"ya'all\". But I definitely would not eat here again. It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down. The turkey and roast beef were bland. This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit. If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!! Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy. Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table. The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section. Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end. I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad. The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten. 5 stars for the brick oven bread app! Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious! I had a pretty satifying experience. Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative. This is one of the better buffets that I have been to. Love the margaritas, too! The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was. It was delicious!!! So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night. Have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!! Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM! And service was super friendly. Bacon is hella salty. Damn good steak. For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go. Oh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant. This place has it! I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it. Wow very spicy but delicious. Everything was good and tasty! If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place. Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service. I don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea. Service is also cute. We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere. Service is friendly and inviting. Now this dish was quite flavourful. On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat. Went in for happy hour, great list of wines. Very good lunch spot. It is worth the drive. Food was great and so was the serivce! That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased. Check it out. (The bathroom is just next door and very nice.) By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had! My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor. They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it! The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated. I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette. The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza. The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable. One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again . It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix! I love their fries and their beans. Def coming back to bowl next time They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world. They were excellent. I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible. Will be back again! this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored. The staff was very attentive. And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him). Highly recommended. So absolutley fantastic. The shrimp tender and moist. Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it. I found this place by accident and I could not be happier. Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing. This is a GREAT place to eat! Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time. That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good. We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast. Good prices. The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked. The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite. Give it a try, you will be happy you did. Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here! After one bite, I was hooked. Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff. My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions. Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had! The jalapeno bacon is soooo good. We'd definitely go back here again. Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while. The seafood was fresh and generous in portion. Sooooo good!! All I have to say is the food was amazing!!! This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here. This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot. My friend loved the salmon tartar. The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh. This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas. I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied. I love this place. I can assure you that you won't be disappointed. Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder. Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner! Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough! Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff. The waitress and manager are so friendly. Good beer & drink selection and good food selection. I can't wait to go back. Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria. No complaints! Eclectic selection. The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special. Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night. You cant go wrong with any of the food here. All the bread is made in-house! When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there. Service is quick and even \"to go\" orders are just like we like it! As for the service: I'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks. The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough. Great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting. He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service. The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me. Service was very prompt. the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean. So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon! If you're not familiar, check it out. The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected. Waitress was sweet and funny. Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!! Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas. Good food , good service . I did not expect this to be so good! I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try. Delicious and I will absolutely be back! DELICIOUS!! I love this place. Best breakfast buffet!!! Overall, a great experience. Wow... Loved this place. Very good, though! Never had anything to complain about here. It's a great place and I highly recommend it. I gave it 5 stars then, and I'm giving it 5 stars now. The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming. This place is two thumbs up....way up. This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff. We enjoy their pizza and brunch. Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant! The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful. Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews. They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good. An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast. Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite. Everything was perfect the night we were in. It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food. The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal! Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup. The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun. Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo. The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked. Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service. Join the club and get awesome offers via email. I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago. My breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar. I hope this place sticks around. The price is reasonable and the service is great. I can say that the desserts were yummy. Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable. The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive. The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had. Seriously flavorful delights, folks. If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once. The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it. This place was such a nice surprise! He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table. The food is very good for your typical bar food. This is an unbelievable BARGAIN! Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for. The Veggitarian platter is out of this world! Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer. Talk about great customer service of course we will be back. This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic. The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff. From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste. If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place. Food was really good and I got full petty fast. I'd love to go back. This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER. They have a really nice atmosphere. I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes. I really enjoyed eating here. The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho! Great Pizza and Salads! Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations. Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot! The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous. Very good food, great atmosphere.1 This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint. Interesting decor. Plus, it's only 8 bucks. Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts. Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat ! The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection. Nargile - I think you are great. Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good. I would recommend saving room for this! This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!! It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends. I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of. They were golden-crispy and delicious. The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth. All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting. Ample portions and good prices. Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...! The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable. In an interesting part of town, this place is amazing. I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service. Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot. The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing. This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!! Both of the egg rolls were fantastic. It was just not a fun experience. Cant say enough good things about this place. The bartender was also nice. Their steaks are 100% recommended! Awesome service and food. Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go! A good time! I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas. The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood. Service was fantastic. A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal. The food came out at a good pace. Great food and awesome service! I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper. Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see. Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place. Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas. High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad. We were promptly greeted and seated. I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm! Fantastic service here. Just had lunch here and had a great experience. The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that. The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut. I also had to taste my Mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious! A great way to finish a great. I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!). This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant. The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside. So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat. This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again. We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC! OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish. The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well. Very very fun chef. The food, amazing. An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman. I will be back many times soon. There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat. The atmosphere here is fun. I'm so happy to be here!!!\" Their chow mein is so good! The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table. Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago! What I really like there is the crepe station. It was absolutely amazing. Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot! On the up side, their cafe serves really good food. We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night. Everyone is treated equally special. This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment. I'll definitely be in soon again. I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia! This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted. Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's. Pretty cool I would say. The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing! The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus. the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit. So they performed. It's worth driving up from Tucson! Best tacos in town by far!! The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh. Our server was super nice and checked on us many times. The cocktails are all handmade and delicious. They know how to make them here. We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed! Great service and food. We loved the biscuits!!! Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas. They really want to make your experience a good one. Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!! The burger is good beef, cooked just right. The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree. Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area. Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I've tried so far and they're all good. The food is good. The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness. Best tater tots in the southwest. Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways. Penne vodka excellent! I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi. Cute, quaint, simple, honest. A fantastic neighborhood gem !!! Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty. It was awesome. The nachos are a MUST HAVE! I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar. I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas! At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff. Waitress was good though! You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care. These were so good we ordered them twice. Service is quick and friendly. I liked the patio and the service was outstanding. All of the tapas dishes were delicious! In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful. They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers. The food was excellent and service was very good. I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great. Great place fo take out or eat in. An absolute must visit! Very friendly staff. I loved the bacon wrapped dates. Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back! They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval. The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices. All in all, I can assure you I'll be back. Great food. Food was good, service was good, Prices were good. The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL! As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious! I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious. My fiancÃ© and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away. And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong. Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount. I *heart* this place. this place is good. I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude! I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious. I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since! The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc. CONCLUSION: Very filling meals. You won't be disappointed. I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable. The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC. Restaurant is always full but never a wait. Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor. The fries were great too. I don't each much pasta, but I love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here. This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious! On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service. I had strawberry tea, which was good. The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options. We loved the place. Nice, spicy and tender. We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience. Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed. The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous. Service was fine and the waitress was friendly. Generous portions and great taste. The roast beef sandwich tasted really good! Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu. I had a seriously solid breakfast here. We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully. Omelets are to die for! They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle. The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning. To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser. Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made. Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it. Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch. The ambiance was incredible. The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested. This place is amazing! The food was very good. The portion was huge! The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR! The food was great as always, compliments to the chef. * Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars! He deserves 5 stars. Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers! This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer. I was seated immediately. I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area (; They also have the best cheese crisp in town. Food was delicious! Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back. you can watch them preparing the delicious food!) The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing. This was my first time and I can't wait until the next. The staff are also very friendly and efficient. Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great. Food was so gooodd. They have great dinners. Best fish I've ever had in my life! Great brunch spot. I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well. The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well. I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine. Ambience is perfect. We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside. Service was good and the company was better!\n"
